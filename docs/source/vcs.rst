Verifiable Credential Service (VCS)
===================================

What is a Verifiable Credential (VC)?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use credentials everyday. A driver's license issued by the government certify
that we are capable of operating a vehicle on the road. A Permanent Residence card
shows the immigration status of an individual.

A verifiable credential is then a document whose contents can be cryptographically proven/verified (VC-TERM_) to be true. 
A VC could hold the same data that a physical credential does.
Within the scope of TrustBloc projects, this act of verifying credentials can be done with the aid
of technology such as digital identities and signatures. The use of digital signatures adds to the integrity
of a credential when it is presented.

Holders of verifiable credentials can generate verifiable presentations and then share these 
verifiable presentations with verifiers to prove they possess verifiable credentials with certain characteristics.
Both verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations can be transmitted rapidly, making them more convenient 
than their physical counterparts when trying to establish trust at a distance. (VC-DEF_)
